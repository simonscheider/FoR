# Repository of resources for discovering spatial Frames of Reference (FoR) in narratives

This repository contains computational resources as well as annotation and validation files used to automatically geoparse FoRs in texts. The resources include:
1. Annotation: Manual annotation files (.tsv)
2. Geoparsing: Geoparser resources, outputs and their quality (.tsv and geoparsing rules)
3. GISmodels: Python models for approximating FoR georeferences. Tests can be run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) by executing `pytest` in the repository's root folder.
